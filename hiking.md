<h2> Logistics </h2>
I usually get a gpx of the hike, upload it to Google maps, add stops, mark
interesting spots, etc. and finally export it as KML and use maps.me on my
phone, which is free and has pretty good offline maps data for hiking trails.

<h2> Favorite Hikes So Far </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Enchantments (near Leavenworth, WA) (3 days, once in 2018 and again in
  2020) - Shield Lake is a real hidden gem. Caught a bunch of alpine trout
  here, which made for good dinner. </li>
  <li> Coast to Coast Hike (13 days in 2018): Enjoyed lake district the most,
  followed by the short section in the beginning along the headland. So many
  nice pubs along the way.

  <li> Hart's Pass to Rainy Pass (2 days, 2020): Stunning wildflowers near
  Hart's Pass, crazy mountain views all round. Camped at Snowy Lakes and could
  see a zillion stars and the milky way at night. </li>
  <li> Glacier National Park (7-days, 2018): Jackson Glacier Overlook to Logan
  Pass. Really liked Sue Lake Overlook.
