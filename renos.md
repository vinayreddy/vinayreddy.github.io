<h2> 19 Jan 2021 (Home Finishes) </h2>

The number of decisions that need to be made is simply staggering. Doors,
windows, hardware, tiles, counter slab, sinks, faucets, showers, tubs, kitchen
appliances, lighting, fireplace, siding style, paint colors... The list is
seemingly endless. To make matters worse, as you learn about an area your taste
evolves. Thankfully, I've made at least one pass through all the items, and multiple
passes through many of them.

Here are a few things I changed my mind on along the way:
<ul>
  <li> Initially wanted a gas dryer for faster drying. Went with a
  high-efficiency Miele dryer as its much gentler on the clothes.</li>
  <li> Initially wanted double-hung windows with muntins. Went with casement
  windows with no muntins. They're easier to clean and let more light in.</li>
  <li> Initially wanted a wood-burning fireplace. Went with a gas fireplace as
  I'd use it more, and the fire looks quite nice. There's no crackling though.
  </li>
  <li> Initially wanted quartzite counter-tops. Went with a dolomite countertop
  (superwhite) as I thought it looked nicer </li>
  <li> Initially wanted a 30" convection oven + regular microwave. Went with a
  plumbed 24" steam oven and a 24" speed oven (that has a microwave). This
  setup is much more functional. The traditional convection oven felt
  obsolete.</li>
  <li> Initially wanted a side-by-side refrigerator. Went with a bottom freezer
  as the side-by-side freezer is really narrow. Also, the crisper is at the
  bottom, which means a lot more bending. </li>
  <li> Initially wanted nanawall for kitchen -> porch door so it opened up
  fully. Went with sliding doors instead as they're easier to operate, the
  panels are larger, and they don't take up space on the inside/outside while
  operating. Downside is of course that they don't open up fully (not enough
  space in the wall to pocket it).</li>
  <li>Initially wanted Warmboard-S as it can act as the structural subfloor and
  also as the radiant panel. Went with a simpler radiant panel only solution as
  it was much cheaper.</li>
</ul>

I bought a fixer-upper in Seattle, WA in Feb 2020 and have been working on
fixing it up. The design/planning phase took about 6 months, and permitting
took about 3 months. Here's a list of things I'm really happy to be
incorporating in my home:

<h3>Kitchen</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Heated kitchen island, so stone isn't cold in the mornings </li>
  <li> Boiling water facuet next to the sink for tea </li>
  <li> Place for cookbooks in the kitchen </li>
  <li> Plumbed steam oven </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bathrooms</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Thermostatic shower mixers </li>
  <li> Wall-mounted faucets so counters are easy to clean </li>
  <li> Curbless showers </li>
  <li> Toe-kick lights in bathrooms for ambient light at night </li>
  <li> Pocket doors for WCs </li>
  <li> Japanese-style heated WC seats and bidets </li>
  <li> Cast-iron plumbing drops and insulation around the pipes </li>
</ul>

<h3>Misc</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Radiant heat in concrete floors, and under wood floors </li>
  <li> Space to add elevator in the future so older parents find it easier when they visit </li>
  <li> Raised hearth for the fireplace, so you can sit next to it </li>
  <li> In-floor power outlet in study </li>
  <li> Green roof on top of the garage </li>
</ul>
